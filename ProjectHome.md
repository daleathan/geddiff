geddiff is a utility conceptually similar to the standard Unix diff utility, but specialized for use on [GEDCOM](GEDCOM.md) genealogical data files.

The ultimate purpose of geddiff is to be utilized by other family history software, such as GRAMPS (see gramps-project.org) or even a revision control system.
