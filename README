geddiff is an effort at implementing a diff-like algorithm for comparison of GEDCOM files. The hope is to put an end to the ridiculous manual, one-at-a-time merge process that currently plagues many family history/genealogy efforts.

==GEDCOM Object Model==
geddiff includes libraries representing the structure of a GEDCOM file, built on top of the low-level GEDCOM callback parser for Ruby developed by Jamis Buck[0]. A copy of Mr. Buck's library is included in our source tree at lib/gedcom-ruby. All of our object model code is available in lib and licensed under LGPL v2.1 or later, as the low-level parser is.

==Diff Algorithm==
We plan to base our algorithm on that proposed in D. Randall Wilson's "Graph-Based Remerging of Genealogical Databases." This is available in PDF format at docs/Wilson - remerge.pdf. The implementation of the algorithm is in src/graph_merge.rb and is licensed under GPL v2 or later.

Essential to this algorithm is an ability to compute a confidence score indicating the likelihood that a record in one database is equivalent to a record in another database. We may port some code from the GRAMPS project[1] that already deals with such comparisons, though we also may just implement our own from scratch.

Text comparison code could come from Edit Distance Alignment[2], amatch[3], or Text[4]

==Prerequisites==
Install Diff::LCS (diff-lcs) from Ruby gems [5]
Install gedcom-ruby library [0]
